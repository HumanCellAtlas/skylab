# Smart-seq2 Multi Sample Pipeline
## Introduction
The Smart-seq2 Multi Sample pipeline is modified from the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/tree/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample) pipeline. It is designed by the Data Coordination Platform of the Human Cell Atlas to process single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data generated by Smart-seq2 assays. The workflow processes multiple cells by importing and running the [Smart-seq2 Single cell workflow](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/blob/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample/SmartSeq2SingleSample.wdl) for each indvidual cell and then merging the resulting Zarr output files. 

More details about the Smart-seq2 pipeline can be read in the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample worflow documentation](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/tree/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample) in GitHub. 
 
## Inputs 

The [Smartseq2PlateExample.json](SmartSeq2PlateExample.json) file provides example inputs for the Smart-seq2 Multi Sample workflow. 

### Sample data Input
The sample data inputs are identifical to those specified in the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample README](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/blob/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample/README.md). The Smart-seq2 Multi Sample workflow processes both single- and paired-end samples; however, these samples can not be mixed in the same run. 

In addition to the Smart-seq2 Single Sample inputs, the multi sample workflow requires the inputs listed in the following table.



### Additional Input
The reference inputs are identical to those specified in the Additional Reference Inputs section of the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample README](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/blob/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample/README.md). 





For the Multi Sample workflow, 
 multiple samples a URL prefix is provided along with an array of filename prefixes 
 under that path. File names are autogenerated by appending _1.fastq.gz and (in the case of 
 paired end) _2.fastq.gz at the end of the filenames
 - Note that single and paired end samples can not be mixed in the same run
