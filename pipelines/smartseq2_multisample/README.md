# Smart-seq2 Multi Sample Pipeline
## Introduction
The Smart-seq2 Multi Sample pipeline is modified from the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/tree/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample) pipeline. It is designed by the Data Coordination Platform of the Human Cell Atlas to process single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data generated by Smart-seq2 assays. The workflow processes multiple cells by importing and running the [Smart-seq2 Single cell workflow](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/blob/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample/SmartSeq2SingleSample.wdl) for each indvidual cell and then merging the resulting Zarr output files. 

More details about the Smart-seq2 pipeline can be read in the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample worflow documentation](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/tree/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample) in GitHub. 
 
## Inputs 

The [Smartseq2PlateExample.json](SmartSeq2PlateExample.json) file provides example inputs for the Smart-seq2 Multi Sample workflow. 

### Sample Data Input
The sample data inputs are identifical to those specified in the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample README](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/blob/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample/README.md). The Smart-seq2 Multi Sample workflow processes both single- and paired-end samples; however, these samples can not be mixed in the same run. 
For the Multi Sample workflow, fastq files must be named with the following convention:

*"sample filename prefix"*\_1.fastq (forward reads for paired-end samples or reads for single-end samples)
*"sample filename prefix"*\_2.fastq (reverse reads for paired-end samples and not applicable to single-end samples)


### Additional Input
The reference inputs are identical to those specified in the "Additional Reference Inputs" section of the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample README](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/skylab/blob/master/pipelines/smartseq2_single_sample/README.md). 

In addition to the Smart-seq2 Single Sample inputs, the multi sample workflow requires the inputs listed in the following table.

| Input name | Input Description | Input Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file_prefix | The URL path to the fastq file folder | String | 
| input_file_names | Array of filename prefixes; workflow will be append with \_1.fastq.gz and \_2.fastq.gz | Array of Strings |
| bacth_id | Identifier for the batch of multiple samples | String |
| output_loom | boolean description for optional loom output | Boolean |
